                        Using agile methodology as an approach to development, we break large projects into smaller parts. Planning is the key to our work. We report on daily basis so that our client knows what has been the progress of the project. Detailed voice conversations with our worthy client leads to develop functionality plan and Acceptance Test Criteria at the start of the project. Once the requirements are set and we are good to go, the client can assign a project manager from his/her company or instead let us assign a project manager.
